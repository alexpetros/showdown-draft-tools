# Draft Nav
A couple tools for planning matchups in Pokemon Drafts


## Instructions
`npm install` when you first download

`npm test` to run the test suite

`./cli.js [TEAM1] [...TEAM2]` to run it

## Teams
I have a folder loaded with everyone's teams for the draft I'm currently in.
Those teams can be found in `/teams`.
I'll add STDIN for teams at some point too.

## Acknowledgments
I forked [Morry's battleTools](https://github.com/wttdotm/battleTools) repo to get started.
